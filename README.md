# COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Objective
Analyze COVID-19 data using SQL to calculate the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and uncover insights into the pandemic’s severity across different demographics and locations.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite – depending on your setup)
- COVID-19 dataset (source: [add dataset link if available])

## 📊 Key Metrics
- **Case Fatality Rate (CFR):** (Total Deaths / Total Confirmed Cases) * 100
- CFR by **Age Group**
- CFR by **Country/Location**

## 📈 Approach
1. Queried and filtered relevant COVID-19 records from the dataset.
2. Aggregated data by age groups and locations.
3. Calculated CFR using SQL expressions.
4. Identified high-risk demographics and countries based on fatality rates.

## 🔍 Insights
- Significant variation in CFR across age groups, with elderly populations showing higher fatality rates.
- Geographic differences indicated higher severity in specific countries and regions, pointing to healthcare disparities and population vulnerability.

## 🧠 Outcome
The project provided actionable insights into the pandemic’s severity, supporting informed decision-making and public health discussions.
